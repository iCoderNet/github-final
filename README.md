# Git Repository Commit Tutorial

This repository serves as a beginner's guide to understanding how to commit a repository to Git. Whether you're new to version control or just looking for a refresher, this guide aims to provide a clear, step-by-step walkthrough of the process.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your files, collaborate with others, and manage your project effectively.

## How to Commit a Repository to Git

Follow these steps to commit a repository to Git:

1. **Install Git:** If you haven't already installed Git on your system, you can download and install it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Initialize a Repository:** Navigate to the directory containing your project files using the command line, and initialize a Git repository by running the following command:

3. **Add Files:** Add the files you want to track to the staging area using the following command:

Replace `<file1>`, `<file2>`, etc., with the names of the files you want to add. You can also use `.` to add all files in the current directory.

4. **Commit Changes:** Once you've added the files to the staging area, commit the changes with a descriptive commit message using the following command:

Replace `"Your commit message here"` with a brief but informative message describing the changes you made.

5. **Push to Remote Repository (Optional):** If you want to push your commits to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), you can do so using the following command:

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to push to. By default, the branch is usually `master` or `main`.
